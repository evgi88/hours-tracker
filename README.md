## Synopsis

This project is going to be a web-app to track hours worked. 

## Code Example

Right now there's a simple version that takes data from CLI and displays result as a response to a GET request. 
To run the project:
``` 
npm start time1 time2 time3 ...
```
Times need to be in the format of hh:mm. 

## Motivation

There are many hourly employees that want an easy way to track their work hours and maybe even do some analysis on the data. The goal of this app is to provide such an option.

## Installation

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/evgi88/hours-tracker.git
```
After cloning, in your terminal of choice, change directories to the root folder of the project and type:
```
npm i
```
This will install all the dependencies. Then you can run the project (see Code Example section)
